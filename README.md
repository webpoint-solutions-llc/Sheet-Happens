## Description

A system designed for time-based CSV file edit from git logs with updates handled through CLI uploads. Each CSV file is uniquely identified using an ID parsed from the URL.

Core Features:

File Uploads and Updates: CSV files are generated and updated through the CLI.

Logging (Slog/API): System operations, including uploads and edits, are logged using a structured logging (Slog) system with API support.

CSV Fetching and Rendering: CSV files are fetched and displayed in an editable table interface.

Metadata Loading: Alongside the CSV data, metadata such as author, description, timestamp, and recipient email are loaded and displayed.

Editable Interface:

Users can directly edit the CSV data within the interface.

Rows can be modified or deleted as needed.

Clean and Efficient Design: The interface prioritizes simplicity and speed, allowing for seamless updates and efficient file management.
